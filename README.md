# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Here we see me first implement Javascript on my HTML. Rock Paper Scissors designed to look like the popular show 'Squid Game' Sucessfully displays a match,
between the player and a random pick from the computer. The javascript also alters both HTML and CSS to better give life to the game by displaying computer choice,
and popping a modal after the match concludes.
